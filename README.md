Welcome to pbrt2ISET!

This repository contains tools that (a) begin with a PBRT file, (b) perform minor edits to the header blocks, and  (c) calls the pbrt-v2-spectral docker image to render a scene spectral radiance or optical image irradiance file.

This repository is allowed to have dependences on RenderToolbox4 and ISET.
