Welcome to pbrt2ISET!

This repository contains tools that (a) begin with a PBRT file, (b) enable the user to edit the header blocks, and (c) call the pbrt-v2-spectral docker image to render a scene spectral radiance or optical image irradiance file.

This repository has dependencies on ISET.  We are trying to eliminate any dependencies on RenderToolbox4.
